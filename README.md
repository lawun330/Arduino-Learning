# Arduino Learning
I learned Arduino in 2018 and did projects throughout the years. This repository is a reflection of my learning journey. 

I create all items except those in the following directories: 
- **collaborations**
- **libraries**
- **useful codes by other people**.

The **in-progress** directory contains files for projects that are still under development.

Since the Arduino platform is open-source, so are my codes. Feel free to fork this repository and use them!!!

You will need to have necesssary electronics components. For an online simulator, [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard/designs/circuits) provides basic functionalities.

For the software, you can install the Arduino IDE [from here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). Note that you have to add libraries in the IDE yourself.
