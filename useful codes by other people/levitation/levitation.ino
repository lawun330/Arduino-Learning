/*
This code is a simplification of the Asier Marzo version, no need to use external pins for synchronization 
and no delays with nops instructions.

This algorithm is optimized to use only a pair of ultrasonic transducers facing each other and an Arduino Nano,
using software interruptions
of an 80 kHz timer, and toggling the state of the pins.

If using  HC-SR04 sensor transducers, be sure to use the emission transducers with a T marked on the back.
